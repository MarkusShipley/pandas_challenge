We are analyzing the Passing math, passing reading, passing both reading and math rates of 39,170 students in 15 schools with a combined budget of approximately 25 million.  When looking at the total summary statistics, the schools appear to be low or struggling in math and just doing slightly better in reading.  The overall passing rate for both math and reading in the PyCitySchools is approximately 80%.  

When working with summary data, one often assumes that budget dollars are allocated evenly per child.   

1.	First observation is that the Summary data warrants a deeper analysis due to the size of the combined school district budget and the low math, reading and overall passing rates.

Next, we look at the top performing and bottom performing schools by % overall passing. The top five schools passing are all charter schools and with a budget ranging between $578 - $638 per student.  The percent of students passing both reading and math is approximately 91%.  The bottom performing schools are all district schools.  The percent passing math approximately 66% with the percent passing both being in the approximately 53%.  The budget range per student for the bottom performing schools is $637 - $655

2.	Second observation is that the Charter schools are getting better student results.  The reason does not appear to be related to budget dollars per student. The bottom performing schools, which are district, seem to be struggling with the passing of math which is pulling down their overeall passing rate.

Next, reviewing the combined scores by grade, does not reveal much because they are aggregated together for both charter and district.

3.	Third observation is that the grades broken down by charter and district would be more useful.  The subsequent analysis will support the theory that charter schools have better math, reading and combined passing scores.  The combined scores are like the first analysis of combined schools â€“ the data is skewed because charter and district are combined.

In the next analysis, the number of students is broken down by quartiles. The quartiles are as shown below:
a.	< 1,858
b.	1,858 to 2,949
c.	2,950 to 4,635
d.	> 4,635

4.	Fourth, the schools with students less than 1,858 students are doing much better across the board.  The smaller schools appear to be doing considerably better in both math, reading and passing overall.  The schools with more than 2,950 students only have approximately 54% passing both reading and math.  Whereas the schools with under 1,858 have a 90.5% passing rate for both.

The final analysis is scores by school type.  The students charter schools are doing much better than the district schools.

5.	Final analysis based on data provided: Charter and smaller schools have a higher rate of passing for math, reading and overall.  District schools and schools larger than 1,858 have an approximate 30% - 40% lower rate of students passing both math and reading.  The % passing both does not appear to have a correlation with budget dollars per student.  The challenge appears to be with the number of students passing math in the district and in schools larger than 1,858 students.  The data analysis warrants further investigation.  A breakdown of grades between district and charter and size group broken down between district and charter would be useful.  A view of budget dollars with these data slices may change the current assumption that budget dollars have little to no real impact.
